        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>Protecting   ry customer’s privacy is our company dedication. All the payments made via our website are secure, because of our processing and unit system. Without any hesitation, customers can use their Credit Card risk-free without information disclosure. The company will have no responsibility if any information is disclosed beyond its control or fault from the customer’s end.</p>
        <p>When placing an order, the company may require every buyer to provide necessary information, including customer identity (name), contact details (if applicable), and a valid email address. Be confident that the provided information will be fully secure in our system database. This information can only be used for contacting the same customer and for verification purposes.</p>
        <p>Once a specific order is placed and assigned to a particular writer, the customer’s attached files and order details become visible to the concerned writer for working purposes. The company takes no obligation if customers deliberately mention their personal information in the details tab or in attachments. This information can include billing information, identity, name, email, and contact number.</p>

        <h2>Order Procedures</h2>
        <p>It is the sole responsibility of the customer to provide a valid email address and correct contact details, which will help the company interact with the customer and build a communication medium.</p>
        <p>In case of any false information provided by a customer, including contact number and email address, it will be considered a violation of rules and a conditional breach of agreement. Providing invalid information may result in penalties in case of any claims from the beneficiary.</p>
        <p>To start the process and work on a specific task, the customer must pay the entire fee in advance to the company. The company takes no responsibility if any customer fails to make the advance payment within the stipulated time.</p>
        <p>Customers can make partial payments for their orders as installments after confirmation from the company’s live chat on-duty support agent.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>Time Duration</h2>
        <p>Providing valid, clear, and detailed instructions within the allocated time is the client’s responsibility. In case of additional instructions from the customer, any missing guidelines or unclear code files may cause delays in completing the order on time.</p>
        <p>The company holds no guaranteed responsibility to deliver the work within the given deadline if something (instructions or brief) is missing from the customer’s end.</p>
        <p>Upon customer request, the company can provide draft work for the placed order to ensure customer satisfaction for further working. Draft requests can only be entertained if the placed order deadline is more than 48 hours.</p>
        <p>If the customer is willing to address only their stated or requested sources for references, the customer must provide the desired file in PDF format.</p>
        <p>Customers must provide detailed instructions while placing the order. If a customer fails to mention instructions or a brief, it is their responsibility to provide detailed instructions within 15% of the order deadline time. For example, in a 24-hour deadline, the customer must provide details and instructions within 3 hours.</p>

    <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>Order Termination</h2>
        <p>If a customer places an order and, for any reason, wants to cancel it, they must inform the concerned assigned agent regarding the cancellation. Cancellation will only be considered valid if the customer informs us within 10% of the actual order deadline, and a 20% processing amount will be deducted upon refund.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For a 24-hour deadline, valid cancellation time is 2 hours.</li>
            <li>For a 48-hour deadline, valid cancellation time is 4 hours.</li>
            <li>For a 3-day deadline, valid cancellation time is 7 hours.</li>
            <li>For a 10-day deadline, valid cancellation time is 24 hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a customer requests cancellation after 10% of the order deadline time has passed, the company will not grant a refund. However, if the refund is approved by the concerned department, only 50% of the actual paid amount will be refunded.</p>
        <p>If 40% of the order deadline time has passed and the customer requests cancellation, the company is not liable to cancel the order. For example, for a 10-day deadline, 40% cancellation time is 4 days.</p>
        <p>In cases where an initial draft has been received, if a customer wants to cancel the order within 10% of the time, the Quality Department will examine the facts. If approved for a refund, 20% processing charges and draft work percentage charges will be deducted from the actual paid amount.</p>
        <p>If a customer places an order that requires specific lab tests, software use, or other experimental work beyond the company’s reach, the company can cancel the order and refund 90% of the actual paid amount, as 10% is charged by the payment processing company on each transaction.</p>
        <p>If a customer places an order without confirmation from the writing department and the requirements exceed the scope of work (e.g., calculations or unique work), the company may ask for an additional amount. If the customer denies additional payment, the company will refund 90% of the actual paid amount, considering the 10% charge by the payment processing company.</p>

        <h2>Unlimited Revisions</h2>
        <p>For revisions, customers are guided that any editing can be done considering initial order instructions and descriptions. The writer has the discretion to use any available valid source for citation, which is available online on the internet.</p>
        <p>Conditional references can be used upon the customer’s request. Online sources include Articles, Journals, Books, Conference Presentations, Newspapers, and other valid studies. In most online libraries, the company can acquire materials for citation. If a customer mentions a specific journal/book for citation and it’s not available for free on the internet, it is the customer’s responsibility to provide the desired book, journal, article, or file within the stipulated time frame.</p>
        <p>Choosing the correct academic level is the customer’s responsibility while placing the order. If a customer mistakenly selects an inappropriate academic level, they should inform us immediately so corrective action can be taken. Selecting the correct academic level helps us assign the work to a writer according to their background and level of education.</p>
        <p>If a customer requests editing, the company reserves the right to cross-check the facts of the submitted work. If the provided details for editing do not match the initial order instructions, an additional amount may be imposed to produce additional work or revisions.</p>
        <p>The company reserves the right to cancel any particular placed order if there is a communication gap or non-cooperative behavior with the customer. The decision regarding recompense will be taken after the concerned team analyzes the facts of termination.</p>
